OpenGL3 Internal Hook with ImGui Impl. (using minhook for detours x64/x86)

# ALWAYS USE LATEST RELEASE! I try to only release stable versions.

# As of right now, the bot looks like this:

All features should be working. If you find any problem just open a new issue.

Everything is done with Rider IDE from Jetbrains. In case you can't run it with your IDE try Rider and delete the OpenGLTemplate.vcxproj.user file if exists.

# TODO:

- Better alerts.
- Find food from inventory and containers.
- Detect nearby creatures.
- UseWith function.

I will probably make this private if no one contributes creating issues or improving/adding features.

# This is only for learning purposes.

Big thanks to Huge Bollocks (specially Edvin, Josh and Martin), tibiapf, guidedhacking and unknowncheats.
